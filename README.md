I've started doing this challenge in 2018. Maybe I will try doing the challenges of the previous years sometime in the future. When that's the case, I'll upload them here. No promises tho.

I didn't upload the input files because I don't know whether I'm allowed to or not. They are accessable on the website above.

Disclaimer: Don't expect idiomatic code.
